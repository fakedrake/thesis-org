\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item FluiDB can efficiently use memory budget to store useful
    intermediate results.
  \item FluiDB is virtually always better than the naive case.
  \item FluiDB can incrementally adapt to the workload.
  % \item It would be interesting to:
  %   \begin{itemize}
  %   \item Cardinality estimation is a major pain point for FluiDB, the
  %     architecture is accomodating to propagation of statistics
  %   \item Parallel query processing
  %   \item Support updates
  %   \item extend the algebra with index-building operators.
  %   \item Drop the C++ compiler.
  %   \end{itemize}
