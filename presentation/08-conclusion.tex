  \begin{itemize}
  \item FluiDB can efficiently use memory budget to store useful
    intermediate results.
  \item It would be interesting to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Cardinality estimation is a major pain point for FluiDB, the
      architecture is accomodating to propagation of statistics
    \item Parallel query processing
    \item Support updates
    \item extend the algebra with index-building operators.
    \item Drop the C++ compiler.
    \end{itemize}
