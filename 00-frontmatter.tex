\chapter{Abstract}%
It is a popular practice to use materialized intermediate results to
improve performance of RDBMSes. Work in this area has focused either on
optimizers matching existing results or selecting useful intermediate
results from a plan, but few attempts have been made to create plans
with intermediate results in mind, and none that make any deduplicate
the stored data to alleviate the storage cost of maintaining possibly
large queries.

We built \emph{FluiDB} to explore a novel approach to integrating the
selection of materialized results with the planner in order to
optimize the logical representation of data in memory. FluiDB
materializes hot intermediate results and deduplucates data to
alleviate the cost of maintaining them. This is achieved by
introducing \emph{reversible operations}, versions of normal relational
operators that optionally pass enough data to the output to make the
input relations reconstructable. A planner aware of such operations
can build query plans that dynamically adapt the data layout to the
plan under constrained memory budget. This thesis revolves around four
main chapters each of which describes in detail a different part of
FluiDB and a final one that goes into evaluation of the system.

The first chapter focuses on query processing and the relational
algebra semantics that FluiDB operates under. FluiDB parses queries
into graphs of sub-queries connected by reversible operators. Each
such graph of the workload is merged into a global query graph that is
used to infer properties of each relation like cardinality and
extent.

The next chapter is dedicated to the planner and a novel monad for
weighted backtracking that the planer is based on. The planner
attempts to generate a plan based on the query graph that besides
solving the query at hand, leaves in memory an optimal set of queries
for the workload being run. In this chapter, the garbage collector is
also discussed, that creates deletion operators as part of the plan
such that the available budget is respected.

After that, we go into \emph{Antisthenis}, a novel incremental
computation system used by the query planner to determine, given a
particular set of materialized relations, whether a relation
materializable and the expected cost of materializing a
relation. Antisthenis, besides reusing computations, takes advantage
of the properties of the operations involved in the expression she is
evaluating, like absorbing group elements, to heuristically avoid as
much work as possible.

The final chapter about the FluiDB architecture describes the
transpilation of plans generated by the planner to C++, as well as the
supporting libraries that enable the evaluation of queries as C++
code, and the low level data organization of the database. The thesis
closes with a chapter that describes our methods for benchmarking and
some experimental results.
